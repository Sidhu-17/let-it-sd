### 🌍 How to Share Music with your Audience (Global Hits)
To make a song appear for **everyone** who visits your site, follow these 3 steps:

1. **Upload the MP3:** Go to your GitHub repository and upload your audio file into the `music` folder.
2. **Rename the file:** Make sure the file name is simple (e.g., `my-song.mp3`).
3. **Update main.js:** 
   - Open `main.js` on GitHub.
   - Look for `const publicTracks`.
   - Change the name, artist, and URL to match your file (e.g., `{ name: "My Hit", artist: "Sidhu", url: "music/my-song.mp3" }`).

Once you commit these changes, the song will appear in the **Global Hits** tab for everyone in the world!
